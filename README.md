# fake OS

This is the repo for my fake OS project. For this project, I replicated the format, layout and interactions of the original macintosh operating system.

This single page application is designed as a landscape desktop operating system and was created using the following tech stack:

-   HTML
-   SCSS
-   javascript

This was my first time using javascript so it was a challenge to get my head around loops, DOM and iterators.

I had fun trying to problem solve the interactive elements. A single PointerEvent can trigger a few functions so it was quite finicky to figure out how to :

-   have a popup move to the front when it is clicked
-   ensure highlighted desktop icons can be opened from file > open
-   ensure only the popup at the front is closed from file > close
-   grey out file > close/close when there were no popups open

I intend to review the code in the future as I know it can still be improved to make it more concise and buildable. There are so many 'features' I thought of adding and it really gave me a new found respect for the people who design and program the UX/UI of operating systems and apps.
